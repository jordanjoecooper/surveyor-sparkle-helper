Netlify forms for form submissions.

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use your preferred IDE to run**
Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

# TODO
- Check form works fully , debounce and sevure it. and add back up to send to email if submission errors.

Can you add a backup to the contact form so that if submission fails it will try to open the persons email client with the info instead - need to handle what happens if form breaks!


If successful, they'll be redirected to the success page
If there's an error, they'll see an error message

Add custom pages for these two.
